# Iron Therapy
### First full-stack application that I made during the Galvanize Coding Bootcamp for our MVP project
### I am now taking time to go back and rework some features to make it more presentable

Iron Therapy is an app that allows users to view excercises and workouts.    
Users are able to create, read, update, and delete workouts.

### Future Plans
Work on the logic to allow real log-ins using authentication and authorization.    
Improve the user experience of creating workouts when adding them to the list.
